  Code Converter: C to Python using CodeT5

This project presents an intelligent system that automates the conversion of C code into Python using a fine-tuned transformer model (CodeT5). It addresses the challenges of manual translation by offering a context-aware and efficient solution suitable for both educational and practical use cases.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset & Model

- Custom dataset generated from C-Python code pairs.
- Data structured in JSON format with `"source"` as C code and `"target"` as Python code.
- Trained and evaluated using the CodeT5 model.
