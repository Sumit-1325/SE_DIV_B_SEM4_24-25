 # Code Converter: C to Python using CodeT5

This project presents an intelligent system that automates the conversion of C code into Python using a fine-tuned transformer model (CodeT5). It addresses the challenges of manual translation by offering a context-aware and efficient solution suitable for both educational and practical use cases.

## 📂 Dataset & Model

- Custom dataset generated from C-Python code pairs.
- Data structured in JSON format with `"source"` as C code and `"target"` as Python code.
- Trained and evaluated using the CodeT5 model.

## 🧠 System Design Overview

1. **Data Collection**: Paired C and Python code.
2. **Preprocessing**: JSON formatting, dataset splitting (train/valid/test).
3. **Environment Setup**: Required dependencies and CodeT5 libraries.
4. **Model**: Loaded pretrained CodeT5 and fine-tuned on the dataset.
5. **Evaluation**: Performance checked against test data.
